# Makefile for building and deploying the Rust-based AWS SAM application
# Includes support for building a custom libpq layer for Diesel/PostgreSQL

# Build the LibpqLayer using the SAM `makefile` build method.
# This is invoked by SAM when building the LibpqLayer defined in template.yaml.
# It copies prebuilt libpq shared objects and headers from our local `libpq_layer/` folder
# into the correct layer output directory (defined by $ARTIFACTS_DIR),
# where they will be placed in `/opt` at runtime in the Lambda environment.

# Build the full SAM application, including all Lambda functions and layers.
# This sets the required environment variables so `pq-sys` can link against the local libpq shared library.
